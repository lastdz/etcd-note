	// progress, it can call Advance before finishing applying the last ready.

	// snapshot (for e.g., while streaming it from leader to follower), should be reported to the
	// leader with SnapshotFailure. When leader sends a snapshot to a follower, it pauses any raft
	// log probes until the follower can apply the snapshot and advance its state. If the follower
	// can't do that, for e.g., due to a crash, it could end up in a limbo, never getting any
	// updates from the leader. Therefore, it is crucial that the application ensures that any
	// failure in snapshot sending is caught and reported back to the leader; so it can resume raft
	// log probing in the follower.
